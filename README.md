## How to register and receive BNB

> You may skip this step if you have already linked your address with a bot made by Sago.

To register and start playing, a player must link their wallet address. 

This can be from metamask, trust wallet or any wallets that is connected to the binance smart chain.

Type and send `.color 0x-paste-address-here` and the bot will save your wallet address to receive your rewards converted to BNB.

The bot does not have any access to your wallet or can do any type of actions on your wallet except to send rewards. 
An address is public and can be copied by anyone to send tokens to your address.

## How to deposit and buy in game tokens

> You may skip this step if you have tokens already in your account.

Type and send `.color deposit` to get the BNB address. 

Open your metamask or trust wallet and send the desired amount to deposit. 

Your deposit will be reflected once the bot has picked up the transaction and will be reflected in your account. 

Type `.color` to see your cash deposit, tokens in game and rewards to claim.

Deposits are strictly non refundable but you can withdraw your tokens and convert it to BNB.


## How to withdraw tokens

## How to play

Choose a color and place a bet with the command `.color red1 green1` or `.color r1 g1`

There are 6 colors to choose from and you can place a bet on all of them.

Once you have sent the command the bot will reply and show the three colors picked randomly.

1. Player types and send  `.color green1` or `.color g1`
2. Robot randomly draw 3 colors: green, red, green
3. Player wins 2x tokens based on your bet.
